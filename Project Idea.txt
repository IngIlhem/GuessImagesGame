My project idea

Game to guess the similar images in a grid

I propose to implment a game that consistes of:
 a grid of 4 lines and 4 columns where images are shown and hide two by two when clicked by the user.
If the two images are similar they continue to be shown else they will be hidden.
He reclick a prefixed number of clickes.
If the counter of clickes is empty he looses and if he has checked all the images he wines.

We need to know how to add a grid in a html and how to get the position when clicked and to compare if they have similar content.
